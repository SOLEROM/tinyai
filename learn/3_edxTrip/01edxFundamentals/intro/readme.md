# intro


How the training loop works.
   You make a guess.
   You measure how accurate that guess is by calculating its loss.
   And then you use that data to make another guess
   with the next guess usually being a little bit better than the current one.
   The idea is that the smaller the loss, the more accurate your guess is.

How minimize your loss. 
  look at how gradients and derivatives can help us
  understand how to minimize loss  - how an optimizer function works.
