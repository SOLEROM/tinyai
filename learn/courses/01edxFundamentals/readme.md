# Introduction


* intro
  * exploring how computers learn with machine learning through fitting internal parameters of a function, or a neuron, to match x and y values together, when there was a linear relationship between them.
  * This is often called regression, where you're using a neural network to predict a single value from one or more inputs.

* block
 * classification, where the network can tell you something about the data.
 * For example, if it's an image, it can tell you the contents of that image.
