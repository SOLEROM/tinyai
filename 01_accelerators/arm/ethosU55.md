# ethosU55

The **Ethos-U55** is an **ultra-low-power micro Neural Processing Unit (NPU)** developed by Arm. It is designed to accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks on **microcontrollers and deeply embedded systems** by offloading neural network operations from the main processor. The Ethos-U55 works in conjunction with ARM Cortex-M CPUs, enhancing their AI capabilities without significantly increasing power consumption or footprint, making it ideal for **TinyML** applications.

Here are some key features of the Ethos-U55:

1. **AI-Specific Hardware Acceleration**: Unlike general-purpose processors, the Ethos-U55 is specialized for neural network tasks like convolutions, fully connected layers, and other operations commonly found in deep learning models. It accelerates tasks such as image classification, object detection, and speech recognition.
   
2. **Optimized for Energy Efficiency**: It provides significant improvements in power efficiency compared to running ML models purely on a Cortex-M core. This is particularly important in battery-operated devices like wearables, IoT sensors, and other low-power applications.
   
3. **Scalable Performance**: The Ethos-U55 can scale performance depending on the configuration and the complexity of the ML tasks. It can be paired with Cortex-M processors of different performance levels, depending on the needs of the application.
   
4. **Tight Integration with CMSIS-NN**: When used alongside **CMSIS-NN**, the Ethos-U55 can further accelerate ML operations, offloading heavy neural network computations to the NPU, while CMSIS-NN handles other tasks on the Cortex-M core.

5. **Broad ML Framework Support**: The Ethos-U55 is designed to work with popular machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM). This makes it easier to deploy pre-trained models on embedded systems.

Overall, the Ethos-U55 provides significant **performance and efficiency improvements** for deploying machine learning models on edge devices, making it a key component in the evolution of AI at the edge.

## board:

Alif Semiconductor Ensemble and Crescendo Families: These microcontrollers combine the Cortex-M55 with the Ethos-U55 to offer significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency for AI/ML workloads. For example, the Alif E7 development kit integrates this combination, providing high performance for tasks like object classification and continuous monitoring. It can deliver up to a 76x improvement in power efficiency over using the Cortex-M55 aloneâ€‹(
