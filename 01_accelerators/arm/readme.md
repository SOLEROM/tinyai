# arm


CMSIS-NN itself doesn't require specific hardware acceleratorsâ€”it is designed to run on standard ARM Cortex-M cores without any additional hardware, though it can benefit from the processor's built-in features like DSP extensions. In scenarios where a microcontroller also includes a specialized AI or neural processing unit (NPU) like the Arm Ethos-U55, further hardware acceleration can be applied in addition to CMSIS-NN to boost performance beyond what software optimizations
