Himax WE-I Plus EVB provides a complete development environment to deploy all TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers examples; “Person detection”, “Micro speech”, and “Magic wand”, for “Vision”, “Voice” and “Vibration” applications.

The WE-I Plus EVB uses a built-in WE-I Plus ASIC (HX6537-A) with embedded Synopsys ARC EM9D DSP running at 400MHz and 2MB internal SRAM and 2MB Flash for larger Neuro Network model deployment. To support “Vision” applications, this board features a Himax HM0360 ultra-low-power VGA mono camera. The latency time for 250KB TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers “Person detection” example is only 40ms. To support “Voice” applications, this board features two MEMS microphones. The latency time of the 20KB TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers “Micro speech” example is only 6ms. To support “Vibration” applications, this board features a STM LSM9DS1 IMU for 3-axis accelerometer function. The WE-I Plus features an ASIC embedded EM9D DSP Floating-Point-Unit (FPU).

Finally, the WE-I Plus EVB has 2 LEDs to indicate classification result and a built-in FTDI USB to SPI/I2C/UART bridge for Flash programming and metadata or message output. It also provides an expansion header with I2C and GPIOs interface to add external sensors or devices.
