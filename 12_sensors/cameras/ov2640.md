The OV2640 is a SOC sensor that has an on-chip ISP which can do auto-exposure, auto-white balance

friendly to most of the low-end ARM and RISC microcontrollers like STM32, ESP32

hardware JPEG encoder, it off-loads the processing power and reduces memory footprint usage from the microcontrollers
A typical 1600×1200 RGB565/YUV format image occupies 3.66MB RAM space, while a JPEG format same decent image only occupies 150KB
