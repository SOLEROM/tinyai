### MVW
* the new Arm Cortex-M55 processor supports MVE, also known as Helium technology

```
Looking ahead into 2021 we can expect a dramatic increase in neural processing from the introduction of devices including a microNPU (Neural Processing Unit) working alongside a microcontroller. These microNPUs are designed to accelerate ML inference within the constraints of embedded and IoT devices, with devices using the Arm Cortex-M55 MCU coupled with the new Ethos-U55 microNPU delivering up to a 480x performance increase compared to previous microcontrollers.
