# mendel linux

* lightweight derivative of Debian 



https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/get-started/



Since Mendel is designed to be run on an ARM CPU core, there are occasionally times where we can't build things using a cross compiler and instead have to emulate the target architecture for a “native” build.


 Unlike other boards like Raspberry Pi, Mendel Linux does not run on the microSD card—we only use the microSD card to install the operating system on the built-in flash memory—you'll remove the microSD card at the end of this process.
