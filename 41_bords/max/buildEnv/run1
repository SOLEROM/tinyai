******************************************
Please follow the instructions below:
Download the dataset to the 'data' folder by visiting this link: 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats'
If you do not have a Kaggle account, sign up first.
Unzip the downloaded file and find 'test' and 'train' folders and copy them into 'data/cats_vs_dogs'. 
Make sure that images are in the following directory structure:
  'data/cats_vs_dogs/train/cats'
  'data/cats_vs_dogs/train/dogs'
  'data/cats_vs_dogs/test/cats'
  'data/cats_vs_dogs/test/dogs'
Re-run the script. The script will create an 'augmented' folder 
with all the original and augmented images. Remove this folder if you want to change the augmentation and to recreate the dataset.
